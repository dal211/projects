Red Number Report Documentation Guide

Developed by David Jan

For inventory management / procurement teams:

- The report is looking a lead time away to see the closest day an inventory shortage will occur based on historical demand. Buyer reviews report to analyze if there is a shortage and reads when the item should be purchased before the predicted shortage occurs.

Action Items: There are two main features features of the report.

Placing an order in anticipation of inventory shortage

- If the Red Number Report says there is a shortage in supply for an item and if the inventory can be ordered within lead time, the buyer should respond by purchasing that short amount

Rushing a PO 

- If there is an predicted shortage out within lead time and there is already an order placed, but it would not come in time for the gap in demand, the report indicates to the buyer that that existing order should be expedited.
