- Summary:
Both in the policy world and the macroeconomics literature, increasing focus has been
placed on the topic of inequality, be it in the realm of wealth, income, or opportunity. In
this report, we promote this focus by highlighting some key facts pertaining to wealth concentration
and income inequality, as well as the links of these topics to the macroeconomic
forces of recessions, population dynamics, and technology. We first examine a popular
theoretical understanding of the distribution of wealth using data from the United States.
Second, we investigate how wealth concentration changed during the Great Recession.
Third, we turn to inequality in income and compare inequality as measured by the Gini
Coefficient to share of labor compensation in GDP across developed countries. Finally,
to dive deeper into the drivers of income inequality, we will look into wages, output, and
employment divided by high-tech and non-high-tech industries.  

- Note: My unique contribution is Fact #2: The bottom 50% of households suffered higher losses in net worth during the
period of the Great Recession than the top 10% of households, further deepening the
divide in wealth inequality relative to before.
