# ClassProjectinR (Descriptive Statistics and Graphs)
This is a class project written in R for CS544 Fundamentals of Analytics in R at Boston University.
It briefly analyzes the relationship between selecting an undergraduate major and its income potential through the variables of starting median income and mid-career median income (10-15 years out).

These are the topics I cover:

1. Preparing the Data
2. Categorical Variables
3. Numerical Variables
4. Distribution of data
5. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) - Demonstrating the CLT using n trials and k samples of the mid-career income variable
6. Sampling Methods - Comparing various sampling methods and how their characteristics compare to the “population” dataset 
7. Simple Linear Regression - Relationship of starting salary predicting mid-career salary
